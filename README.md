# GWIC backend

## Paystack wallet setup

Configure `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in the backend environment. Use a Paystack test secret for sandbox testing; use a live secret only when ready to process real money. Never add either key to source control or frontend environment variables.

Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the deployed frontend origin so Paystack can return users to the dashboard after checkout.

Configure this webhook URL in the Paystack dashboard:

```text
https://gwic-backend.onrender.com/api/paystack/webhook
```

The endpoint verifies Paystack's HMAC signature and handles `charge.success`, `transfer.success`, `transfer.failed`, and `transfer.reversed` events. Keep it publicly reachable over HTTPS.

Deposits are limited to ₦100–₦1,000,000 per transaction. Wallet funds are credited only after the backend verifies a successful Paystack transaction. Withdrawals require at least ₦100, sufficient confirmed wallet funds, and a resolved Nigerian bank account whose holder name matches the user's profile name (case, spaces, and punctuation ignored). Withdrawals are sent from the business Paystack balance; failed or reversed transfers are returned to the wallet.

Paystack can require approval for transfers depending on the account's transfer security settings. In that case, the withdrawal remains reserved and pending until Paystack reports a final transfer event.

The authenticated `GET /api/wallet/transactions?page=1&type=all` endpoint returns wallet activity newest-first in pages of 20. `type` accepts `all`, `deposit`, or `withdrawal`; the response includes `total` and `hasMore` for pagination.
